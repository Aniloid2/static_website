<!-- Hi! I'm Brian Formento, A PhD student in the school of computer science{https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/} at the national university of singapore{https://www.nus.edu.sg/}, doing researh in the exiting field of deep learning! I'm a recipiant of the SINGA scholarship{https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa} and under the supervision of Professor See-Kiong Ng{https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/} and Dr. Chuan Sheng Foo{http://ai.stanford.edu/~csfoo/}. I'm original from Enlgand where i graduated with a MEng in electronic engineering{https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/electronic-engineering-with-artificial-intelligence-degree-meng} from the University of Southampton. I was originaly born in Turin Italy{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turin} and moved to England at a young age, where i lived across the country, predominately Reading{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading,_Berkshire}, Bath{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset}, Portsmouth{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portsmouth}, Manchester{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester} and Birmingham{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham}. I'm Passionate in deep learning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision and web development.


 I'm a big fan of grand strategy games such as Europa universalis 4, crusaider kings 3 and my favorite victoria 2. The later started my curiosity towards economics which i often read about in my own time. I'm especialy a fan of the austrian school of economics and litterature from their proponents, individuals such as luig von mises, eugine banberverk and murray rothbard where my favorite book is chaos theory by Robert Murphy-->




<!-- Map Widget Installation
There are two code snippets below. The first method is based on javascript and it's recommended for most users:

Copy
<script type="text/javascript" id="clustrmaps" src="//clustrmaps.com/map_v2.js?d=ty09RAsw8XDJ5mqjepIMYGDqV1tUtAbF0LJD32z0BZI&cl=ffffff&w=a"></script>
Unfortunately some blogging platforms don't support javascript (Livejournal, Google Sites). In this case the only available option is plain image embed code:

Copy
<a href="https://clustrmaps.com/site/1bv2i" title="Visit tracker"><img src="//www.clustrmaps.com/map_v2.png?d=ty09RAsw8XDJ5mqjepIMYGDqV1tUtAbF0LJD32z0BZI&cl=ffffff"></a>
Important note: Сode must be placed into the body section of your html between <body> and </body> tags. Please do NOT place it into the header.

Installation Guides for: Wordpress.org, wordpress.com, Blogger/Blogspot, Tumblr, Wix and more...

Your website statistics will appear at the https://clustrmaps.com/site/1bv2i upon successful install of the tracking code -->
